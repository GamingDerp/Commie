# Privacy Policy for Commie
### Effective Date: July 11th, 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Commie Privacy Policy**. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users ("you," "your") of the privacy practices of Commie, a Discord bot created and developed by GamingDerp ("we," "our," "us"). Commie is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.

# Policies
## 1. Message Data Collection

Commie may collect limited message data solely for the purpose of recognizing when a command is used. This data does not include the content of messages and is used exclusively to improve the bot's functionality. We do not collect or store any invasive or personally identifiable information.

## 2. Opting Out

Users cannot opt out of message data collection since no data is stored or used for any purpose beyond immediate command recognition. The data collected is transient and not linked to any specific user or server.

## 3. Data Retention

Commie does not retain any message data long-term. The transient data collected for command recognition is not stored beyond the immediate need to process the command.

## 4. User Rights

You have the right to inquire about the data we collect and request its deletion. Since we do not store any personal data, such requests can be accommodated promptly.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking

Commie does not use cookies or any other tracking mechanisms to collect information about your online activities.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Commie may interact with third-party services or websites, such as Discord's API, but it does not share or transmit any personal information to these services.

## 7. Data Security

We take data security seriously and implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Commie does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information from our records.

## 9. International Users

By using Commie, you consent to the processing of your data in the country where the bot is operated, which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. We will ensure compliance with applicable international data protection laws, including GDPR.
